## Church Bells - Electron App

My Dad has his computer tell him the time every 15 minutes in this really jarring computer voice. I told him it was not pleasant and we both agreed that the sound of church bells is far better. With that in mind I decided to make him a simple Electron app that rings church bells every 15 minutes and on the hour. 1 short peels for 15 after the hour, 2 short peels for the half hour, 3 short peels for 3/4 hour, and long deeper peels for however many hours it is.

I could make this more complex, but simple is probably best as this is the first time I've made an Electron app.
